*This program is just answers I came up with to a couple basic Interview questions using Javascript.*



What I learned doing these exercises:

#Javascript:
* How to use `||` (or)
* How to use && (and)
* How to write functional functions (no pun intended :D)
* The nature of `return`
* When to use returns
* How to use `.length`
* A deeper understanding of problem solving
